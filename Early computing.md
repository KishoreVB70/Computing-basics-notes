1. Abacus
	- Hand operated calculator
2. Step reckoner
	- Mechanical version of the abacus
	- Very fast to do calculation than the abacus
3. Pre computed tables -> book containing all the huge calculations
	- Military mainly used the mathematical tables to calculate the angle of artillery based on the varying distance of the target and the wind conditions
	- When the artillery design or shell design changed, the whole book is wasted and a new book has to be made which is time consuming task
	- This is the problem which inspired Charles Babbage's 'note on the application of machinery to the computation of mathematical tables'
4. Difference Engine -> calculation of polynomials
	-  Babbage proposed the **Difference Engine** in 1822 which could calculate polynomials( describe relationships). It was never made and was abandoned after 2 decades
5. Analytical engine -> General purpose computer
	- During the time of development of the difference engine, he got the idea for the much advanced  The analytical engine was different from any existing solution. The analytical engine was a **General purpose computer**. 
	- This went on to inspire many scientist, hence he is the father of computing
6. The Tabulating machine -> Electro mechanical computer
	- is invented by Herman Hollerith for calculating the 1890 US census
	- It is a **Electro mechanical** computer. People would use punch cards to punch for their sex, martial status and stuff. When the punch card is passed through the machine, the pin would connect to the mercury if it is punched, and when punched, the count on the sex is increased mechanically
	- The machine saved the census **10 million dollars** which was the stepping stone into corporate companies wanting the machine to cut down their cost and increase their speed.
	- The demand for the product lead to the invention of the tabulating machine company which merged with other machine makers in 1924 to become **IBM**
7. Z3 is the first programmable computer 
	- In 1941. It was also electromechanical and built using relays. The program code is stored in punched film
8. Harvard Mk 1 -> 1944 -> biggest electromechanical computer and the first in the states
9. Electromechanical computers consisted of relays which would pass on 
	- They were becoming slow for the booming economy, relays can switch back and forth only 50 times a second
	- Multiplication took several seconds
	- They were mechanical and prone to wear and tare
	- Big computation = high number of relays = high probability of failure
	- Summary of the issues with the EM computers
		1. Slow for the increasing needs
		2. Failure of the mechanical components
	- Hence a **faster**, more **reliable** component for the switch is needed
10. Vacuum tubes
	- 1904 -> **thermionic valve**
	- 2 electrodes inside vacuum bulb
	- One electrode heated -> emit electron -> thermionic emission
	- Other electrode -> attract the electrons to form flow of current
	- Only if positively charged = attract electron, if it is negatively charged, then doesn't conduct electricity
	- It is called the **Diode**
	- Third component -> control wire -> we can open or close the gate. Positive charge to control wire -> flow of electrons
	- This is **Triode**
	- It is the same as relay but **entirely electronic**
	- Disadvantage -> Fragile electrodes -> burn out like light bulbs
	- It was not initially used in computers due to their huge cost, eventually by 1940s it become feasible for governments to procure and use it
11. Colossus Mk 1
	- First large scale computer to use vacuum tubes instead of relays
	- Complete in 1943 in the UK to decrypt German stuf
	- **First programmable electronic computer**
	- Wires are plug into plug boards 
12. ENIAC
	- Electronic numerical integrator and calculator
	- 1946, UC of Pennsylvania
	- First **general purpose computer**
	- Operational for 10 years -> Done more arithmetic than the entire human race
	- But vacuum tubes failed and some of the time, it was not functional
	- Disadvantages
		1. Cost
		2. Reliability
		3. Size
13. Transistors
	- By 1950's new switches were in high requirement
	- Invented in 1947 -> bell laboratory 
	- Same principle as vacuum tube, allows the flow of electron based on the charge of control wire
	- Consist of 2 electrodes separated by a **semiconductor**
	- The charge of the control wire is applied to the semiconductor which is also called the **gate electrode**
	- It then allows to pass the electricity
	- On and off -> 10k times a second
	- It was not fragile -> **solid material**
	- It was very small
	- It was very cheap -> silicon i
14. IBM 608
	- 1957 -> First fully transistor powered commercial computer
	- All computers till now use transistors, the innovation is that they are only nano meters(3nm) in size
